# Emacs Melpa Packages

I am going to list the packages that I seem to always use and come back to
I should move these to an elisp file that will ensure that they are installed
But then I will have to learn elisp to do that

## Packages

Below are the packages I use all the time. This git repo is an impressive list and collection
of some of the best and awesome packages available:

[Awesome Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs)

Also, I wanted to give some shout-outs to great emacs pioneers that have helped learn and use emacs.
The urge and need to continuously improve and tinker with emacs will never end.
