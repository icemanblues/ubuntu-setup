## XX Things to do After Installing Ubuntu

There are many websites that offer advice and steps to finish tweaking and setting up a new Ubuntu installation.
This repo does *NOT* replace them. In fact, we recommend you read them and tweak to your heart's content.

This repo is for specific post install configs and setup that I like on my Ubuntu desktop.
And it serves as a way for me to store these configs so that its easy for me to re-install Ubuntu with a clean slate.

Very similar to the `git ops` philosophy of configuration management
